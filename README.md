```
streamserve -address :44100 \
            -source-buffer 40 \
            -frame-bytes 44100 \
            -reopen \
            -close-idle=false \
            -exec arecord -f cd --file-type raw

streamserve -address :6464 \
            -content-type audio/mpeg \
            -source-buffer 1000 \
            -frame-bytes 300 \
            -frame-filter mp3 \
            -reopen \
            -close-idle \

```

Features / design goals

* Fast. Laptop should handle 1000 clients easily.
* Small. Use well under 1GB RAM when serving 10 streams to 10K clients.
* Stream sort-of-streamable formats like mp3.
* Drop frames when clients are too slow.
* Keep clients online while sources fail and resume.
